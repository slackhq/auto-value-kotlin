AutoValue Kotlin
================

auto-value-kotlin (AVK) is an [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) extension that generates
binary-and-source-compatible, equivalent Kotlin `data` classes. This is intended to help migrations
by doing 95% of the work and just letting the developer come through and clean up the generated file
as-needed.

The intended use of this project is to ease migration from AutoValue classes to Kotlin data classes
and should be used ad-hoc rather than continuously. The idea is that it does 95% of the work for you
while leaving obvious placeholders or TODOs in places that require manual adjustment.

## Installation

Add the dependency to kapt

```kotlin
dependencies {
  kapt("com.google.auto.value:auto-value:<version>")
  kapt("com.slack.auto.value:auto-value-kotlin:<version>")
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].

Configure the following arguments in your build file

```kotlin
kapt {
  arguments {
    // Source dir to output files to. This should usually be the src/main/java or src/main/kotlin
    // path of the project you‚Äôre running this in.
    // REQUIRED
    arg("avkSrc", file("src/main/java"))

    // Colon-delimited string of simple class names to convert
    // OPTIONAL. By default, AVK will convert all AutoValue models on the compilation.
    arg("avkTargets", "ClassOne:ClassTwo")

    // Boolean option to ignore nested classes. By default, AVK will error out when it encounters
    // a nested AutoValue class as it has no means of safely converting the class since its
    // references are always qualified. This option can be set to true to make AVK just skip them
    // and emit a warning.
    // OPTIONAL. False by default.
    arg("avkIgnoreNested", "true")
  }
}
```

## Workflow

_Pre-requisites_
* Move any nested AutoValue classes to top-level first (even if just temporarily for the migration).
  * You can optionally choose to ignore nested classes or only specific targets per the configuration
    options detailed in the Installation section above.
* Ensure no classes outside of the original AutoValue class accesses its generated `AutoValue_` class.
* Clean once to clear up any generated file references.

Add the AVK configuration to your project's build file

Run the kapt task, such as `./gradlew :path:to:library:kaptReleaseKotlin` or `/gradlew :path:to:library:kaptKotlin`.

Now you'll see generated equivalent Kotlin files in the source set defined by `avkSrc`.

_Repeat the following for each generated file._
- Open the original AV file and change the class name to something else, so it doesn‚Äôt link in the IDE to existing places. For example: rename `class AuthModel` to `class AuthModelOld`.

- Open the generated Kotlin file (i.e. `AuthModel.kt`). The file will look a little noisy, but this is by design to intelligently best-effort preserve Java and Kotlin interop.
    1. You shouldn‚Äôt need to edit any Java usages ü§û, only Kotlin usages to switch to the property accessors. The generated deprecated functions will have `@JvmName` annotations with funny values that hide them from Java callers.
- For any `@Deprecated` functions, these are functions that may have existing Kotlin usages that need to be updated. These come with `ReplaceWith` information to allow the IDE to auto-migrate these where possible. For each of these, you should‚Ä¶
    1. Put your cursor on the first line of the function (it looks like a recursive call)
    2. option+enter on it to bring up inspections, then click ‚ÄúReplace all usages in project‚Äù.
    3. Delete the function

- For any ‚Äúplaceholders‚Äù, these are cases where AVK couldn‚Äôt migrate them automatically. This includes final non-property methods, static factories/helpers, etc. For these, it‚Äôs best to copy them in the original AV file (i.e. from AuthModel.java) and paste them into the new Kotlin file. The IDE will automatically ask if you want to convert it to Kotlin and do most of the work for you.

- When done, delete the old Java file.
  - If you want to go the extra mile for review and have git recognize the file migration, you can rename it first with no changes, commit the rename, then commit the content changes in a separate commit.

When done with all the migrations, revert the added AVK configuration to your build file and be done with it!

## Supported features/interop

* Basic nullability
* Builders
